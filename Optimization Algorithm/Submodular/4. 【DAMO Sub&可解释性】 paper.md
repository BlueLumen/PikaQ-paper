记录几个思考<br/>

1. 或许可以将我研究的那个子集选择的问题，引入某个规则。借鉴一下这个可解释性的东西。
2. 呼应了一下数据挖掘课程上提到的关联规则，以及对这种早期算法的缺陷，通过可解释性的角度，指出这种关联规则的生成缺乏全局目标。不知道啥意思，感受就好了。

```
Associative classification techniques [33, 50] developed by data mining community take a different two-stage strategy,
in which a large set of rules are first generated via association rule mining and then a rule set is constructed by ranking and pruning. 
Both these early approaches lack a global objective that guides the generation of rules and optimizes the
interpretability of produced rule set.
```
3. 或许可以学一下下面这种表述方式，以后写论文可能用得到：

```
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Related work is summarized in Section 2. Section
3 introduces the problem formulation. Section 4 presents the algorithmic details. Experimental
evaluation is reported in Section 5. We discuss the limitations of this work in Section 6 and conclude
the paper with Section 7.
```

4. 这篇论文提到了几个思路，或许可以将次模函数进行一个作差之类的，看看效果？不知道submodular的封闭性如何。
